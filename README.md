This repo holds several scripts for the analysis of ozone over Iran.

There are two branches:

*GlobalModel*: in which two models are evaluated using a new methodology.

The package is a set of scripts to:

- assess the models

- plot the outputs

- map the stations

More information can be found in: [Assessment of Tropospheric Ozone Products from CAMS Reanalysis and CAMS Daily
